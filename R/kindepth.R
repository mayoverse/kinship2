#' Individual's depth in a pedigree
#'
#' @description
#' Computes the depth of each subject in the Pedigree.
#'
#' @details
#' Mark each person as to their depth in a Pedigree; `0` for a founder,
#' otherwise :
#'
#' \deqn{depth = 1 + \max(fatherDepth, motherDepth)}
#'
#' In the case of an inbred Pedigree a perfect alignment may not exist.
#'
#' @param ... Additional arguments
#' @inheritParams Ped
#' @param align_parents If `align_parents = TRUE`, go one step further
#' and try to make both parents of each child have the same depth.
#' (This is not always possible).
#' It helps the drawing program by lining up pedigrees that
#' 'join in the middle' via a marriage.
#'
#' @return An integer vector containing the depth for each subject

    ## align Assume that subjects A and B marry, we have some ancestry
    ## information for both, and that A's ancestors go back 3 generations,
    ## B's for only two.
    ## If we add +1 to the depth of B and all her ancestors, then A and B
    ## will be the same depth, and will plot on the same line.
    ## Founders who marry in are also aligned. However, if an inbred
    ## Pedigree, may not be a simple fix of this sort.

    ## The algorithm is 1 First deal with founders. If a founder marries in
    ## multiple times at multiple deaths (animal pedigrees), given that
    ## subject the min(depth of spouses). These subjects cause trouble for
    ## the general algorithm below: the result would depend on the data order.
    ## 2. Find any remaining mother-father pairs that are mismatched in depth.
    ## Deal with them one at a time.
    ## 3.  The children's depth is max(father, mother) +1.
    ## Call the parent closest to the children ``good'' and the other ``bad''.
    ## 4. Chase up the good side, and get a list of all subjects connected to
    ## 'good', including in-laws (spouse connections) and sibs that are at this
    ## level or above.  Call this agood (ancestors of good).  We do not follow
    ## any connections at a depth lower than the marriage in question, to get
    ## the highest marriages right.  For the bad side, just get ancestors.
    ## 5. Avoid pedigree loops!  If the agood list contains anyone in abad, then
    ## don't try to fix the alignment, otherwise: Push abad down, then run the
    ## pushdown algorithm to repair any descendents --- you may have pulled
    ## down a grandparent but not the sibs of that grandparent.

    ## It may be possible to do better alignment when the Pedigree has loops,
    ## but it is definitely beyond this program, perhaps in auto_hint one day.
