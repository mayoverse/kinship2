\title{Alignment second routine}
\usage{
alignped2(idx, dadx, momx, level, horder, packed, spouselist)
}
\arguments{
\item{idx}{Indexes of the subjects}

\item{dadx}{Indexes of the fathers}

\item{momx}{Indexes of the mothers}

\item{level}{Vector of the level of each subject}

\item{horder}{A named numeric vector with one element per subject in the
Pedigree.  It determines the relative horizontal order of subjects within a
sibship, as well as the relative order of processing for the founder couples.
(For this latter, the female founders are ordered as though
they were sisters).
The names of the vector should be the individual identifiers.}

\item{packed}{Should the Pedigree be compressed.
(i.e. allow diagonal lines connecting parents to children in order
to have a smaller overall width for the plot.)}

\item{spouselist}{Matrix of spouses with 4 columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{1}: husband index
\item \code{2}: wife index
\item \code{3}: husband anchor
\item \code{4}: wife anchor
}}
}
\value{
A list containing the elements to plot the Pedigree.
It contains a set of matrices along with the spouselist matrix.
The latter has marriages removed as they are processed.
\itemize{
\item \code{n} : A vector giving the number of subjects on each horizonal level of the
plot
\item \code{nid} : A matrix with one row for each level, giving the numeric id of
each subject plotted.
(A value of \code{17} means the 17th subject in the Pedigree).
\item \code{pos} : A matrix giving the horizontal position of each plot point
\item \code{fam} : A matrix giving the family id of each plot point.
A value of \code{3} would mean that the two subjects in positions 3 and 4,
in the row above, are this subject's parents.
\item \code{spouselist} : Spouse matrix with anchors informations
}
}
\description{
Second of the four co-routines which takes a collection of siblings,
grows the tree for each, and appends them side by side into a single tree.
}
\details{
The input arguments are the same as those to \code{alignped1()} with the
exception that \strong{idx} will be a vector. This routine does nothing
to the spouselist matrix, but needs to pass it down the tree and back
since one of the routines called by \code{alignped2()} might change the matrix.

The code below has one non-obvious special case. Suppose that two sibs marry.
When the first sib is processed by \code{alignped1} then both partners
(and any children) will be added to the rval structure below.
When the second sib is processed they will come back as a 1 element tree
(the marriage will no longer be on the \strong{spouselist}), which should be added
onto rval. The rule thus is to not add any 1 element tree whose value
(which must be \code{idx[i]} is already in the rval structure for this level.
